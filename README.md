# Task 8: VPN Setup and IP Verification

#### By: Yug Dabgar (aka MASTERxD)

## Overview
In this task, I tested a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to understand how it changes your IP address and encrypts internet traffic. I used TuxlerVPN, a simple desktop-based VPN client, to simulate safe browsing and verify IP masking.

## VPN Tool Used
- TuxlerVPN (Free version)
- Platform: Windows

## What I Did

1. **Checked my IP without VPN**  
   - Visited `whatismyipaddress.com` to record my real IP

2. **Connected to VPN using Tuxler**  
   - Selected a different country/location and turned the VPN on

3. **Verified IP after VPN**  
   - Revisited `whatismyipaddress.com` to confirm my IP had changed

4. **Captured Screenshots**  
   - Before and after IP
   - VPN client showing active connection

## Screenshots
- `ip_before_vpn.png` – Original IP before VPN
- `ip_after_vpn.png` – IP shown while VPN was connected
- `vpn_connected.png` – Tuxler app showing active connection

## Key Learnings
- VPNs help **mask your real IP** and make your activity more private
- They route your traffic through **encrypted tunnels**
- Public Wi-Fi users especially benefit from VPN use
- Free VPNs are useful for testing, but **paid VPNs** offer stronger privacy and speed

## Conclusion
Using TuxlerVPN, I was able to confirm that my IP address changed successfully and my traffic was routed through a different location. VPNs are a simple but powerful way to improve security when browsing online, especially on untrusted networks.
